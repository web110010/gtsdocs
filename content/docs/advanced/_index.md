# Advanced

In this section we touch on a number of more advanced topics, primarily related around deploying, operating and tuning GoToSocial.

We consider these topics advanced because applying them incorrectly does have the possibility of causing client and federation issues. Applying any of these configuration changes may also make it harder for you to debug an issue with your GoToSocial instance if you don't understand the changes that you're making.

## Guides

* [Split-domain deployment (API vs. account domain)](host-account-domain)
* [Using an HTTP proxy for client/outgoing requests](outgoing-proxy)
* [Provisioning TLS certificates](certificates)
* [Caching API responses](caching/api)
* [Serving and caching assets and media from local storage](caching/assets-media)
* [Process sandboxing](security/sandboxing)
* [Firewall configuration](security/firewall)

# Enhanced security

These guides cover improving the security posture of your GoToSocial deployment. They don't involve tweaking settings in GoToSocial, but rather additional things you can do to better lock down your instance.

**Note**

Anything in these guides is meant to enhance the security of your GoToSocial deployment; they are not a replacement for good security practices like keeping your systems patched and up to date.

# Firewall

You should deploy a firewall on your instance to close off any open ports and give you a mechanism to ban potentially misbehaving clients. Many firewall frontends will also automatically install some rules that block obvious malicious packets.

It can be helpful to deploy tools that monitor your log files for certain patterns and automatically ban clients exhibiting certain behaviour. This can be use to monitor your SSH and web server access logs for things like SSH brute-force attacks.

## Ports

For GoToSocial, you'll want to ensure port `443` remains open. Without it, nobody will be able to reach your instance. Federation will fail and client apps won't be able to work at all.

If you [provision TLS certificates](../../certificates) using ACME or GoToSocial's built-in Lets Encrypt support, you'll also need port `80` to be open.

In order to access your instance over SSH, you'll need to keep the port your SSH daemon is bound on open too. By default this is port `22`.

## ICMP

[Internet Control Message Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) are exchanged between machines in order to detect certain network conditions or troubleshoot things. Many firewalls have a tendency of blocking ICMP entirely but this is undesirable. A few ICMP types should be allowed and you can use your firewall to configure rate limiting for them instead.

### IPv4

In order for things to work reliably, your firewall must allow:

* ICMP Type 3: "Destination Unreachable" and also aids in Path-MTU Discovery
* ICMP Type 4: "Source Quench"

If you want to be able to ping things or be pinged, you should also allow:

* ICMP Type 0: "Echo Reply"
* ICMP Type 8: "Echo Request"

For traceroute to work, it can be helpful to also allow:

* ICMP Type 11: "Time Exceeded"

### IPv6

ICMP is heavily relied on by all parts of the IPv6 stack and things will break in exciting and hard to debug ways if you block it. [RFC 4890](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4890) was specifically written to address this and is worthwhile to review.

Roughly speaking, you must always allow:

* ICMP Type 1: "Destination Unreachable"
* ICMP Type 2: "Packet Too Big"
* ICMP Type 3, code 0: "Time Exceeded"
* ICMP Type 4, code 1, 2: "Parameter Problem"

For ping, you should allow:

* ICMP Type 128: "Echo Request"
* ICMP Type 129: "Echo Response"

## Firewall configuration

On Linux, firewalling is typically done using either [iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) or the more modern and faster [nftables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nftables) as the backend. Most distributions are switching to nftables and many firewall frontends can be configured to use nftables instead. You'll need to refer to your distribution's documentation on the matter, but typically there will be an `iptables` or `nftables` service your init-system can start with a predefined location to load firewall rules from.

Doing this by hand using raw iptables or nftables rules offers the most control but can be challenging if you're not familiar with these systems. In order to help with that, a number of configuration frontends exist that you can use.

On the Debian and Ubuntu as well as openSUSE family of distributions, UFW is commonly used. It's a simple firewall front-end and many tutorials targeting those distributions will be using it.

For the Red Hat/CentOS family of distributions, firewalld is typically used. It's a much more advanced firewall configuration utility which also has a desktop GUI and [Cockpit integration](https://cockpit-project.org/).

Despite distribution preferences, you can use UFW, firewalld or something else entirely with any Linux distribution.

## Brute-force protection

[fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org) and [SSHGuard](https://www.sshguard.net/) can be set up to monitor your log files for attempts to brute-force logins and other malicious behaviour. They can be configured to automatically insert firewall rules to block malicious IP addresses, either for a specific period of time or even indefinitely.

SSHGuard was initially designed just for SSH, but nowadays supports a variety of services. Fail2ban tends to support anything you can generate consistent log lines for, whereas SSHGuard's signature approach can catch more sophisticated or stealthy attacks as it computes an attack score over time.

Both SSHGuard and fail2ban ship with "backends" that can target iptables and nftables directly, or work with your frontend of choice like UFW or firewalld on Linux or pf on \*BSD. Make sure you review their documentation on how to correctly configure it.

# Releases

GoToSocial can be installed in a number of different ways. We publish official binary releases as well as container images. A number of third-party packages are maintained by different distributions and some people have created additional deployment tooling to make it easy to deploy GoToSocial yourself.

## Binary releases
We publish binary builds for Linux to [our GitHub project](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/releases):

* 32-bit Intel/AMD (i386/x86)
* 64-bit Intel/AMD (amd64/x86_64)
* 32-bit ARM (v6 and v7)
* 64-bit ARM64

For FreeBSD we publish:

* 64-bit Intel/AMD (amd64/x86_64)

## Containers

We also publish container images [on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial).

Containers are released for the same Linux platforms as our binary releases, with the exception of 32-bit Intel/AMD.

## Third-party

Some folks have created distribution packages for GoToSocial or additional tooling to aid in installing GoToSocial.

### Distribution packages

These packages are not maintained by GoToSocial, so please direct questions and issues to the repository maintainers (and donate to them!).

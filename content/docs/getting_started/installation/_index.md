# Installation

As we noted in [Releases](../releases), we publish official binary release as well as containers. We have a number of guides available on how to deploy your own GoToSocial instance this way.

Before proceeding with your installation, please ensure you've read through the [Deployment considerations](../deployment_considerations) first and have a domain and server ready to go.

Also take a minute to familiarise yourself with [how to configure](../../configuration) GoToSocial.

## Guides

For third-party releases we don't provide guides on how to use them. You need to refer to their own documentation instead. Our guides might still be useful to review in order to familiarise yourself with which configuration options you likely want to set and tweak.
